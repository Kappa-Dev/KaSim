------------------------------------------------------------
* Dead rules :
------------------------------------------------------------
rule 2: r3 will never be applied.

------------------------------------------------------------
* Dead agents :
------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------
* Relational properties:
------------------------------------------------------------
In agent A, the binding state of site z is B@z whenever the binding state of site t is B@t.
In agent B, the binding state of site t is free whenever the binding state of site z is A@z.

------------------------------------------------------------
* Non relational properties:
------------------------------------------------------------
The binding state of site t in agent A ranges over free and B@t.
The binding state of site z in agent A ranges over free and B@z.
The internal state of site x in agent A is always u.
The binding state of site t in agent B ranges over free and A@t.
The binding state of site z in agent B ranges over free and A@z.
The internal state of site x in agent B is always u.

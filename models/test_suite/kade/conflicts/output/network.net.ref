# THINGS THAT ARE KNOWN FROM KAPPA FILE AND KaSim OPTIONS:
# 
# init - the initial abundances of each species and token
# tinit - the initial simulation time (likely 0)
# tend - the final simulation time 
# initialstep - initial time step at the beginning of numerical integration
# maxstep - maximal time step for numerical integration
# reltol - relative error tolerance;
# abstol - absolute error tolerance;
# period - the time period between points to return
#
# variables (init(i),y(i)) denote numbers of embeddings 
# rule rates are corrected by the number of automorphisms in the lhs of rules
# reaction rates are corrected by the product, for each species, of the factorial of the number of occurrence of this species in the lhs

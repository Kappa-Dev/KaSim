#In this example, each A has three sites which can be activated or
#not. A configuration can be seen as the vertice of a cube, put the
#movement between these vertices are constrained.

#The observable can be triggered by activating x, then z. Or by
#activating y, then activating x, then activating z, then
#desactivating x, then deactivating y, then activating x.

#Both ways are compressed in the same causal flow.

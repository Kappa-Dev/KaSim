#In this example A and B are synchronized. 
#They are either both activated, or both not activated. 

#Thus the observable should never be triggered. 

#If some causal flows were found nonetheless, it would mean that observables are checked component wise (rectangular observation), but the check that each component is triggered simulataneously is not done.
